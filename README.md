## Super clipboard

This is a simple clipboard logging tool designed to log and retrieve previous clippings.

I found other extended clipboards to have a limit of 100 too low for me. 	

TODO: 
- [ ] command line args to turn on logger or launch gui based on logger running
- [ ] os specific clippings
- [ ] gui
