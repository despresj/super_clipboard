## Super clipboard

This is a simple clipboard logging tool designed to log and retrieve previous clippings.

I found other extended clipboards to have a limit of 100 too low for me. 	

TODO: 
- [ ] os specific clippings
- [ ] gui selector key input
- [ ] gui append multiple clippings
- [ ] launch gui on keyinput
- [ ] move log file to generic dot in root
- [ ] error handling
